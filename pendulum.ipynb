    "To give a sense of what can be achieved with TorchRL\\'s environments, we\n",
    "will be designing a *stateless* environment. While stateful environments\n",
    "keep track of the latest physical state encountered and rely on this to\n",
    "simulate the state-to-state transition, stateless environments expect\n",
    "the current state to be provided to them at each step, along with the\n",

    "Modeling stateless environments gives users full control over the input\n",

    "solving a problem where we cannot control the current state is more\n",
    "challenging but has a much wider set of applications.\n",

    "Another advantage of stateless environments is that they can enable\n",
