    "To give a sense of what can be achieved with TorchRL\\'s environments, we\n",
    "will be designing a *stateless* environment. While stateful environments\n",
    "keep track of the latest physical state encountered and rely on this to\n",
    "simulate the state-to-state transition, stateless environments expect\n",
    "the current state to be provided to them at each step, along with the\n",
    "action undertaken. TorchRL supports both types of environments, but\n",

    "\n",
    "Modeling stateless environments gives users full control over the input\n",

    "that we have some control over a task, which may not always be the case:\n",
    "solving a problem where we cannot control the current state is more\n",
    "challenging but has a much wider set of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of stateless environments is that they can enable\n",
